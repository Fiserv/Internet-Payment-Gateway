### Fraud Detect Integration

_The following information is only relevant if you are using the First Data Fraud Detect solution._

The information required to be forwarded to Fraud Detect to obtain a fraud score is pulled from both your merchant master data and the information sent to perform the transaction. The only addition will be if you want to pass mobile device details to be included in the scoring.

<span lang="EN-US">In&nbsp;this case&nbsp;the below additional information needs to be passed these with the following parameter naming:</span>

  * <span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">customParam_deviceRiskId </span></span></span></span>
  * <span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">customParam_deviceRiskAPIKey </span></span></span></span>
  * <span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">customParam_deviceRiskHost</span></span></span></span>

<span lang="EN-US">Example:</span>

<pre><span lang="EN-US"><span>&lt;input type="hidden" name="customParam_deviceRiskId" value="*****"/&gt;</span></span></pre>

<span lang="EN-US"><span>These fields are handled in the same way as other optional request parameters. The gateway stores these parameters and passes them on to Fraud Detect. These parameters have no impact on the transaction processing flow.</span></span>
