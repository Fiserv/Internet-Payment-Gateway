Currency Conversion
---

<span lang="EN-US">Foreign customers have the choice to pay for goods and services purchased online in their home currency when using their Visa or MasterCard credit card for the payment. International Visa and MasterCard eCommerce customers can make informed decisions about their online purchases and eradicate any unexpected pricing or foreign exchange conversions on receipt of their monthly statements.</span>

<span lang="EN-US"><span lang="EN-US">If you use hosted forms for the payment process in your webshop and your Store has been activated for this product option, a currency choice is automatically provided to your customers if the card they use has been issued in a country with a currency that is different to your default currency.</span></span>
