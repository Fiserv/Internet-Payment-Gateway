<span>The result screen will contain all the information you entered, plus an extra section at the top called <em>Transaction Information</em>.</span>

<span>&nbsp;For retail merchants who need a receipt for the customer to sign, there is a print receipt function. Simply click on the <em>Show Receipt</em> button at the bottom of the <em>Transaction Result</em> page. A new browser window will open with a transaction receipt. Click on the <em>Print Receipt</em> button at the bottom of the <em>Receipt page</em> to print the receipt. Once you have printed all the receipts you need, close the receipt window by clicking on the <em>Close </em>button at the bottom or on the <em>X</em> in the top right hand corner of the <em>Receipt</em> window.</span>

<span>&nbsp;The <em>Transaction Information</em> section is where you will see whether the transaction was approved or declined. If the transaction was approved, the <em>Transaction Status</em> line will say <em>Approved</em>. The <em>Date</em> and <em>Time</em> of transaction, a <em>Transaction reference</em> <em>number</em>, an <em>Approval Code</em>, and a <em>Reference number</em> will follow.</span>
