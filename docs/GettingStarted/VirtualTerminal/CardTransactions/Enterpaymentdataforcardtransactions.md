<span><em><span>Virtual Terminal: Card data input fields<span>&nbsp;</span></span></em></span>

<span>To enter card information, follow the steps below:</span>

<span>&nbsp;</span>

**_<span>Step 1:</span>_**** <span><em>Select the Card Type (optional)</em></span>**

<span>First, select the card type from the <em>Select card type</em> dropdown box or click on one of the brand logos.</span>

<span>&nbsp;</span>

**_<span>Step 2: Select the Transaction Origin</span>_**

<span>Select the transaction origin from the <em>Transaction Origin</em> dropdown box.</span>

  * <span><span><span><span>Select <em>Retail</em> (face to face) if the customer and the card are in your presence. </span></span></span></span>
  * <span><span><span><span>Select <em>Electronic Commerce</em> (internet) if the order came to you over the Internet or<br /> via e-mail.</span></span></span></span>
  * <span><span><span><span>If you received the order over the phone or through the mail, select <em>Mail Order/Telephone Order</em>.</span></span></span></span>

_<span>&nbsp;</span>_

_<span>Transaction Origin</span>_ <span>is always a required field therefore you must make a selection.</span>

<span>&nbsp;</span>

**_<span>Step 3:</span>_**** <span><em>Select the Transaction Type</em></span>**

<span>Once you've selected the transaction origin, select the appropriate transaction type for your card transaction in the <em>Transaction Type</em> dropdown box.</span>

  * <span><span><span><span>Select <em>Sale</em> to charge the customer's card immediately (upon batch settlement)</span></span></span></span>
  * <span><span><span><em><span>Authorise Only</span></em><span> to reserve funds on the customer's card, but not complete the transaction yet</span></span></span></span>
  * <span><span><span><em><span>Forced Ticket</span></em><span> to complete a voice authorisation transaction.</span></span></span></span>
  * <span><span><span><em><span>Account authorization</span></em><span> to only validate a card (Visa or MasterCard) with a zero value amount </span></span></span></span>

<span>&nbsp;</span>

<span>If you need to do any other type of transaction, you'll need to visit another page. To complete an Authorise Only transaction, go to the <em>Completion</em> page. To do a Return, go to the <em>Return</em> or the <em>Credits</em> page.</span>

<span>&nbsp;</span>

_<span>Transaction Type</span>_ <span>is always a required field, but if you do not make a selection, it defaults to <em>Sale</em>.</span>

<span>&nbsp;</span>

**_<span>Step 4:</span>_**** <span><em>Enter the Card Number or Swipe the Card</em></span>**

<span>Enter the card number in the <em>Card Number</em> field. You may include spaces or dashes if you wish.</span>

<span>&nbsp;</span>

<span>If the card is present and you have the appropriate reader (configured correctly), place your cursor in the <em>Card Number</em> field, and then swipe the card through the reader. The <em>Card Number</em> field should be automatically filled in for you. If it is, there is no need to enter any other data.</span>

<span>All other required fields (except <em>Transaction origin</em> and <em>Transaction type</em>) become optional because the entire customer's data is passed to us from this one entry.</span>

<span>If something should go wrong and this field does not fill in when you swipe the card, check your reader to make sure it's configured correctly. If the reader is configured correctly and you are still unable to swipe the card, the card may be unreadable. Go to the previous field (<em>Are you swiping the card?</em>), uncheck the <em>Yes</em> checkbox, and enter the card data manually.</span>

<span>Note: If your store has been activated for GlobalChoice™ please click <a href="http://test-ndpfdc.pantheonsite.io/org/gateway/node/57"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a> for further information.</span>

&nbsp;

**_<span>Step 6:</span>_**** <span><em>Enter the Expiry Date</em></span>**

<span>Select the card's <em>Expiry Date</em> from the dropdown boxes. Select the month first, then the year that the card expires.</span>

<span>&nbsp;</span>

**_<span>Step 7: Enter the Card Security Code</span>_**

<span>The <em>Card Security Code</em> is a 3 or 4-digit number usually found on the back of the customer’s credit card, on the same line as the customer’s signature, following the last four digits of the credit card number. There are many different names for this code: Visa calls this code CVV2, MasterCard calls it CVC2, American Express 4DBC.</span>

<span>&nbsp;</span>

**_<span>Step 8: Enter the Reference Number (required only for Forced Ticket transactions)</span>_**

<span>If you are performing a Forced Ticket transaction, enter the reference number associated with this transaction (typically given to you over the phone with the authorisation) in the <em>Reference Number </em>box. The <em>Reference Number</em> field will not appear unless you have chosen <em>Forced Ticket</em> as the transaction type.</span>

**_<span>&nbsp;</span>_**

**_<span>Step 9: Enter the Number of Instalments (optional, if merchant is configured for instalments)</span>_**

<span>If your store has been enabled for instalments, you can enter the number of instalments to complete the payment. You must include a numeric field.</span>

<span>&nbsp;</span>

**_<span>Step 10: Continue to the Customer Contact Information section</span>_**

<span>Click on <em>Customer Contact Information</em> to expand the text, and then enter the appropriate fields. The <em>Customer ID</em> is a unique identification number you can choose for the customer.</span>
