<span>The Virtual Terminal offers you the timesaving ability to choose items from your product catalogue every time you process an order. To enable this feature, you first need to enter your product catalogue using the <em>Manage your Product Catalogue</em> function in the <em>Customisation</em> section. For every product you have entered, you can click on <em>Edit</em> to add options (e. g. colour, size etc.). Once you've done that, simply go to the <em>Virtual Terminal </em>main page and click on the <em>Select Products</em> button to select products for this order. The <em>Product Catalogue</em> page will appear.</span>

<span>&nbsp;</span>

**_<span>Adding Products to the Order</span>_**

<span>The top half of the page is the <em>Product Summary</em> table, which lists all the products in your product catalogue. To add products to the order in progress, simply enter the desired quantity of a particular product in the <em>Qty</em> (quantity) column. If there are any options for this product, they will appear in the <em>Options</em> column of this table. Select the appropriate choices by choosing one of the choices available in the dropdown box (e.g., colour: red, size: 5), then click on the <em>Add Item(s)</em> button below the table.</span>

<span>The correct quantity, choices, product description, price, and total should appear in the <em>Selected Products</em> table on the bottom half of the page.</span>

**<span>&nbsp;</span>**

**_<span>Removing Products from the Order</span>_**

<span>If you have made an error in entering any of the product quantities or options, you can delete the product(s) from the order very easily by checking the checkbox for that line item in the <em>Selected Products</em> table, then clicking on the <em>Delete Item(s)</em> button located just below the table. To delete all the products in the order, click on the checkbox at the top left corner of the <em>Selected Products</em> table (this selects all the items in the order), then click on the <em>Delete Item(s)</em> button.</span>

<span>&nbsp;</span>

**_<span>Completing the Order Process</span>_**

<span>Once you've completed your product selections, click on the <em>POS Main</em> button to return to the <em>Virtual Terminal</em> main page, where you can enter payment and contact information for this order.<br /> A table should appear at the top of the page showing all the products selected for this order along with the subtotal of the order. </span>
