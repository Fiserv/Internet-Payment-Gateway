<span>The <em>Payment Details</em> section for Direct Debit transactions shows fields for the customer’s IBAN (International Bank Account Number), the BIC (Business Identifier Code - which is required in case of transactions with a foreign IBAN), the Account Holder, an optional field for the Mandate Reference and a drop-down menu for the Mandate type.</span>

<span>If you do not enter a Mandate Reference, a mandate reference starting with the prefix ‘IPG’, a time stamp and a random value will automatically be assigned.</span>

<span>If you set the Mandate type to Recurring, an additional mandatory field appears where the Mandate Date needs to be entered.</span>
