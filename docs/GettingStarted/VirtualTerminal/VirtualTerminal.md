If you want to enter transactions manually, e.g. to take orders via phone or to run a Void or Return, our _Virtual Terminal_ is the ideal solution.

<span>The <em>Virtual Terminal</em> is the main page which you will use for all your Sale, Authorise Only as well as Forced Ticket transactions and for creating Payment URLs that allow consumers to make the payment at a later point.</span>

<img alt="Virtual Terminal" data-align="center" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="81c50481-f29d-4afd-91d8-d61161f32bd7" height="95" src="Virtual%20Terminal.png" width="586" /> 

<span>Since some of the other types of card transactions such as Completion and Return, need to look in the database to get order information, they have their own pages. Credit is a special transaction that not all users have access to, so it also has its own page.</span>

<span>A hide/reveal function is available for all sections of the page, which can expand to provide additional options or fields - such items are identified by a right-arrow graphic. When clicked upon, the arrow changes to point downward and the expanded choices are revealed. Clicking again reverses the process.</span>

&nbsp;

### <span>Performing a Sale transaction</span>

<span>To do a Sale transaction, you will need to complete all the required fields from the following sections. Then, fill in additional fields as appropriate for your transaction. Follow these steps to perform a Sale transaction.</span>
