### Tokenization with JavaScript
---

<span><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Tokenization with JavaScript allows you to use the advantages of an API interaction (server-to-server) and at the same time benefit from a solution that keeps sensitive card details away from&nbsp;your own systems, alleviating compliance with the PCI Data Security Standard.</span></span></span></span></span>

In a first step, you tokenize card details that you can then use for later payment transactions via [API requests][1]&nbsp;that include the token instead of card details.

This option&nbsp;gives you maximum flexibility for the look and feel of the entry form in your webshop while a JavaScript library encrypts the sensitive information before it hits your servers. This can be an alternative to a [Direct Post][2]&nbsp;integration if you are only looking for tokenization and plan to handle all subsequent steps with our APIs.

The JavaScript for tokenization works across multiple Fiserv solutions including First Data Gateway.  
Please see integration documentation here: [Payment.js][3]
